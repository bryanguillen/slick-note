# Friendly Note

## Summary 

In today's world, we have everything at the tip of our fingers with a cellphone, and because of that, we have an issue of having way too
much information in our heads. And a true and tested way of learning and embodying new material is by writing notes down. It serves 
both as an exercise to learn and artifact to look back on. With friendly note, you have a super simple way of creating new notes, 
accessing published current notes, and dividing the notes by sections in order to make it easier to learn a new topic. Making it an easier
and a more organized way of writing and keeping track of notes. 

Below are some screen shots of the app at work.
